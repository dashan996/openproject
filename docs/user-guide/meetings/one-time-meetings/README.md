# One-time meetings

With OpenProject 15.3, meetings were enhanced by introducing a clear distinction between **one-time meetings** and **recurring meetings**. This page covers the features and functionalities of one-time meetings in OpenProject.

For information on setting up recurring meeting series and templates, please refer to [this page](../recurring-meetings). Note that individual occurrences of a recurring meeting series are one-time meetings and have the same features as described here.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Meetings module needs to be activated** in the [Project settings](../../projects/project-settings/modules/) to be able to create and edit meetings.

## Create and edit one-time meetings

### Create a new meeting

You can either create a meeting from within a project or from the global **Meetings** module.

To create a new meeting, click the green **+ Meeting** button in the upper right corner and select what type of meeting you want to create. You can choose between **one-time, recurring or classic meetings**. 

![Create new meeting in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_create_meeting_button.png)

For steps on creating a classic meetings please consult [this page](../classic-meetings). For steps on setting up recurring meetings please consult [this page](../recurring-meetings).

If you choose the **one-time** option, enter your meeting's title, location, start date and time, and duration. 

If you are creating a meeting from a global module you will first need to select a project to which the meeting is attributed. 

![Create a new one-time meeting in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_new_onetime_meeting_form.png)

> [!TIP] 
> Duration can be entered both in hours and minutes. For example for a meeting that should last for 1.5 hours, you can enter:
>
> - 1.5h
> - 90m
> - 90min
> - 1:30

Click the **Create meeting** button to save your changes. You can  then proceed to add more details to the meeting.

### Create or edit the meeting agenda

After creating a meeting, you can set up a **meeting agenda**.

You can do this by adding sections, agenda items or existing work packages by selecting the desired option under the green **+ Add** button. You can then add notes to each agenda item.

![The add button in OpenProject meetings module with three choices: section, agenda item or work package](openproject_userguide_meetings_add_agenda_item_button.png)

#### Add an agenda section 

Sections allow you to group agenda items into blocks for better organization.

To add a section, click on the **+ Add** button at the bottom of the agenda items and select the **Section** option. 

![Add a new section to a meeting agenda in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_add_section.png)

If, prior to creating your first section, your meeting already had existing [agenda items](#add-an-agenda-item), they will automatically be contained in a section called **Untitled section**. You can rename this section if you wish. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you use sections, all agenda items must have sections.

![Untitled section in OpenProject meeting](openproject_userguide_meetings_untitled_section.png)

After adding a section, you can specify it further by [adding agenda items](#add-an-agenda-item) or [work packages](#link-a-work-package-to-a-meeting) to it. 

You can also add agenda items to specific sections by either dragging and dropping items into each section, or by clicking on the **More** button (⋯) and choosing your desired action.

![Edit or delete a section in an OpenProject meeting](openproject_userguide_meetings_section_more_menu.png)

This menu also lets you rename a section, move it or delete the entire section by selecting the respective option from the dropdown menu behind the **More** (⋯) icon on the right side. If a section is moved, the agenda items will move along with it. 

> [!TIP]
>
> You can also re-arrange sections by dragging and dropping sections up and down.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a section will delete all containing agenda items. If a section contains agenda items, you will be asked for confirmation before deletion.

#### Add an agenda item

If you select the **Agenda item** option, you can name that item, add notes, set the anticipated duration in minutes and select a user to be displayed next to the agenda item.  This could for example be a meeting or a project member that is accountable for the item or someone who will present that particular topic. 

![Add an agenda item to a meeting section](openproject_userguide_meetings_add_section_items.png)

By default, when creating an agenda item, this will be pre-filled with the name of the user adding the agenda item, but it can either be removed or replaced by one of the other meeting participants.

![Form for adding agenda items to meetings sections in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_add_section_items_form.png)

Sections will show the sum of all the durations of all containing items (or at least, those that have a duration specified).

![Duration of a section in OpenProject meeting](openproject_userguide_meetings_section_duration_sum.png)

> [!TIP]
> If you need to store the agenda outside of OpenProject, you can generate an optimized PDF using the print function (Ctrl/Cmd + P).


#### Link a work package to a meeting

If you select the **Work package** option, you can link a work package by entering either a work package ID, or starting to type in a keyword, which will open a list of possible options.

![Add work package](openproject_userguide_meetings_add_work_package.png)

#### Edit a meeting agenda

After you have finalized the agenda, you can always edit the agenda items, add notes, move an item up or down or delete it. Clicking on the **More** (three dots) menu icon on the right edge of each agenda item will display a menu of available options, including editing, copying link to clipboard, moving the agenda item within the agenda or deleting it.

![Menu showing options to edit agenda items in OpenProject meetings](openproject_userguide_meetings_agenda_item_more_menu.png)

You may also re-order agenda items by clicking on the drag handle (the icon with six dots) on the left edge of each agenda item and dragging that item above or below.

![Drag handle next to an agenda item in OpenProject meetings](openproject_userguide_meetings_agenda_item_drag_handle.png)

The durations of each agenda item are automatically summed up. If that sum exceeds the planned duration entered in *Meeting Details*, the duration of those agenda times that exceed the planned duration will appear in red to warn you of the fact.

![Meeting agenda items duration sum is greater than the meeting duration set in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_agenda_too_long.png)

### Add a work package to the agenda

There are two ways to add a work package to a meeting agenda.

- **From the Meetings module**: using the **+ Add** button [add a work package agenda item](#link-a-work-package-to-a-meeting) or
- **From a particular work package**: using the **+ Add to meeting** button on the [Meetings tab](../../work-packages/add-work-packages-to-meetings)

You can add a work package to both upcoming or past meetings as long as the work package is marked **open**.

![Button to add a work package to a meeting under Meetings tab in a work package in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_add_wp_to_meeting_agenda.png)

> [!TIP]
> The upcoming meetings are displayed in chronological order, from the nearest meeting to the most distant. 
> The past meetings are displayed in reverse chronological order, from the most recent meeting to the oldest.


### Edit a meeting

If you want to change the details of a meeting, for example its time or location, open the meetings details view by clicking the cogwheel icon next to the **Meeting details**.

![A cogwheel icon to edit a meeting in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_cogwheel_icon.png)

An edit screen will be displayed, where you can adjust the date, time, duration and location of the meeting.

![A form to edit an existing meeting in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_edit_meeting_form.png)

Do not forget to save the changes by clicking the **Save** button. Cancel will bring you back to the details view.

> [!TIP]
> If someone else edits or updates the current meeting page at the same time and saves their changes, you and all other users on the same page will be notified of this with a small banner at the top of the page. Click the **Reload** button to load the updated version of the page.

![Banner notifying that a meeting has been updated while a user is editing it in OpenProject meetings module](openproject_userguide_meetings_page_update_reload_button.png)

In order to edit the title of the meeting select the dropdown menu behind the three dots and select the **Edit meeting title**.

![Edit a meeting title in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_edit_meeting_title.png)

## Meeting participants

### Add meeting participants

You will see the list of all the invited project members under **Participants**. You can add participants (Invitees and Attendees) to a meeting in [edit mode](#edit-a-meeting). The process is the same whether you are creating a new meeting or editing an existing one. You can either click the cogwheel icon next to **Participants** section or click the **Add participants** link under the list of existing participants.

![Add meeting participants in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_add_participants.png)

You will see the list of all the project members and be able to tell, based on the check marks next to the name under the *Invited* column, who was invited. After the meeting, you can record who actually took part using the checkmarks under the Attended column.

![A form showing invited and attending meeting participants in OpenProject](openproject_userguide_meetings_add_new_participants_form.png)

To remove an invited project member from a meeting, simply uncheck both check marks.

Click on the **Save** button to confirm the changes.

### Send email to all participants

You can send an email reminder to all the meeting participants. Select the dropdown by clicking on the **More** (three dots) icon in the top right corner and select **Send email to all participants**. An email reminder with the meeting details (including a link to the meeting) is immediately sent to all invitees and attendees.

## Meeting attachments
